-- 1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL

-- 2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

-- 3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept=dept.id

-- 4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

-- 5. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266')
FROM teacher;

-- 6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name.
-- Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

SELECT teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name,'None')
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept=dept.id

-- 7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

SELECT COUNT(teacher.name), COUNT(mobile)
FROM teacher

-- 8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff.
-- Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name)
FROM teacher
RIGHT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept=dept.id
GROUP BY dept.name

-- 9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci'
-- if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

SELECT name,
CASE WHEN dept IN (1,2)
THEN 'Sci'
ELSE 'Art'
END
FROM teacher

-- 10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the
-- teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

SELECT name,
CASE WHEN dept IN (1,2)
THEN 'Sci'
WHEN dept = 3
THEN 'Art'
ELSE 'None' END
FROM teacher

-- 1. Select the code which uses an outer join correctly.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher LEFT OUTER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)

-- 2. Select the correct statement that shows the name of department which employs Cutflower -

SELECT dept.name FROM teacher JOIN dept ON (dept.id = teacher.dept) WHERE teacher.name = 'Cutflower'

-- 3. Select out of following the code which uses a JOIN to show a list of all the departments and number of employed teachers

SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name) FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept GROUP BY dept.name

-- 4. Using SELECT name, dept, COALESCE(dept, 0) AS result FROM teacher on teacher table will:

display 0 in result column for all teachers without department

-- 5. Query:
-- SELECT name,
--        CASE WHEN phone = 2752 THEN 'two'
--             WHEN phone = 2753 THEN 'three'
--             WHEN phone = 2754 THEN 'four'
--             END AS digit
--   FROM teacher
-- shows following 'digit':

'four' for Throd

-- 6. Select the result that would be obtained from the following code:
--  SELECT name,
--       CASE
--        WHEN dept
--         IN (1)
--         THEN 'Computing'
--        ELSE 'Other'
--       END
--   FROM teacher
